# pyMate: process (primate) fMRI and e-phys data

## What is it?
**pyMate** is a Python package that provides basic functionalities to process functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
and electro-physiological (e-phys) data.
The tooling has a focus on the analysis of simultaneous fMRI and e-phys recordings
in non-human primates (NHPs) as acquired in the AGLO lab at the MPI for Biological Cybernetics.
